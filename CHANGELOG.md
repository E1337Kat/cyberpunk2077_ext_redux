# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.10.1

> Lead developer and not good at writing person here, again. This is not part 'B' of River. This is just a tribute. I will try to continue picking off the things that I can when I see them. I fixed my dev environment a bit and real world is letting up for the holidays, so I will try and get things going a bit more, but I know better than to make a promise.

Update directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files


## Main Jobs

- ✨Add explicit support for Mod Settings. Sorry about that one, I probably would have noticed it sooner had I been playing lately.
- ✨Add support for Red4Ext mods to install with bundled redscript files without complaining. I think this is actually gonna fix a long standing bug that I didn't catch before... so we'll see.

**Full Changelog**: [v0.10.0-a...v0.10.1](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/compare/v0.10.0-a...v0.10.1)

## Detes

We'll collect any tutorials, walkthroughs and other info on the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196) for you!

## The Crew

Just Ellie (@E1337Kat) this time around, but we're grateful for the help from that has not let me slip away quietly. Really need to get back into the game.

As always, thanks to all of you for your feedback, suggestions, bug reports, support, and in this case a little patience too!

# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.10.0-a "River"

> Lead developer and not good at writing person here. I went with the name River for this release because we are planning for it in two parts (an 'A' and 'B') like a river flows from point A to point B because I like puns. Also like a river, we, the development team, is still flowing forward to try and add features, fix bugs that we are able to fix, and hopefully continue to make it easier to use Vortex for Cyberpunk 2077 modding as we go forward. I wish I had the creative spark to write up the fun passages that my co-dev writes, but hopefully this isn't too trash. if it is, let me know. It won't change anything, but I can at least know I affected someone with my shit writing. 

Update directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

Why use a mod manager? In addition to supporting REDmods and every other kind of mod there is for CP2077, there's the quality-of-life improvements like automatically fixing many common types of mod structure problems that you'd have to do by hand, clear (?) instructions on any possile additional steps for any given mod or problem encountered, and the easy ability to enable/disable mods, you also get profiles to manage separate sets of mods more easily, update notifications, much easier game upgrades, easy toggling between multiple versions or variants (e.g. colors) of a mod, Collections, and all sorts of nice things. And you can of course install mods from any source - even the mod showcase channel, and they do not even need to be in a zipfile. We gotchu.

As always, all feedback is appreciated so we can ensure that no bugs or oversights have slipped through our testing — and any suggestions and ideas are welcome too! Please get in touch either on Discord, Github, or Nexus (links at the bottom).

## Main Jobs

- ✨ **Modlist File Support** The latest cyberpunk update added a feature to redmod to allow deploying mods specified in a file. When we read that, we knew we had to get right on it to fully remove the mod count limit on REDmods (Eat it NetWatch!)


**Full Changelog**: [v0.8.3...v0.10.0-a](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/compare/v0.8.3...v0.10.0-a-gonk)

## Detes

We'll collect any tutorials, walkthroughs and other info on the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196) for you!

## The Crew

Mostly Auska (@effs) and Ellie (@E1337Kat) this time around, but we're grateful for the help from CDPR and @rfuzzo for adding this feature (and another feature we will be adding in part b of River's quest)!

# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.8

## Main Jobs

- ✨ **Input Loader v0.1.1 Support** (and you can still install v0.1.0, too, but shouldn't.)

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

- 🛡️ **More Robust Load Order Protection** There were some cases in which a race condition or unexpectedly deleted `V2077` directory could cause the Load Order to be reset. Put a Cerberus on it, see 'em weefles try it now.

---


# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.7

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐛 **I GUESS WE NEEDED A HINT TOO** Redscript mods can now include a hints file in `r6/config/redsUserHints/`

# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.6

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐛 **ArchiveXXXXXXL** ArchiveXL 1.3.4's new Redscript API file supported in our known layout

---

# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.5

## Fixer Gigs

- 🚩 **Autoconversion is off by default** Beware the mean reds.

---

# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.4

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐛 **Spyder Murphy's Law** The special archive handling in CET, Redscript, and Red4ext mods is gone, which means that now all archives can be autoconverted. (They're auto-convertible :get-it-doggo:)

- 🐛 **Wear the Colors** The few mods that were proactively splitting archives between REDmod and classic now work correctly in the load order when autoconverted — both halves show up and can be independently ordered (they are still a single Vortex mod, though, so you can only enable or disable _both_.)

---
# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.3

Quick and dirty, 'cause what else is there in Night City?

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐛 **cYbEr PuNk 2o77 Ex3** Since the 'case-insensitive' Windows filesystem doesn't _actually_ do a whole lot to guarantee any protection against any sort of problem, much like NCPD, there's a minor workaround to allow `cybercmd` to use case-sensitive comparison (until their fix is in.) To wit, we now spell `Cyberpunk2077` as `Cyberpunk2077`, not `cyberpunk2077`. Computers are great.

- 🐛 **:spy:** No more autoconvert tags in mod names to reduce the name length, which is actually becoming a problem with ~200 REDmods installed. This defers the problem slightly, but we need to solve it better unless the next version of `redMod.exe` will allow file-based input.

- 🐛 **DND: off** Show notifications for starting _and_ completing an on-demand REDdeployment.

---
# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.2

A nice new gig and a bit of fixing for v0.9.0

## Main Jobs

- ✨ **ArchiveXL REDmod support!** ArchiveXL can now be installed in REDmods, including for MultiType mods. Autoconversion from heirloom ArchiveXL is also supported both standalone and along with `.archive` files.

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐛 **redMod.exe will now always deploy order-only changes too!** The `redMod.exe` tool doesn't currently correctly handle cases where only the load order is changed without enabling/disabling mods at the same time. Until that's fixed upstream, Vortex will default to force deployment. It's unfortunately slower, but hopefully won't get in the way too much because it's running in the background.

- 🐛 **REDmodding DLC check won't fail on non-store games!** 

## Chippin' In - Tools of the Trade

- ⚒️ **Run the game directly, `-modded`, no launcher.** If you don't need the launcher, you can launch the game directly and still get the modded goodness (it's in the toolbar at the top, or on your dashboard.) 

---

# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.1

Bugfix update to v0.9.0, see full changelog below.
## Fixer Gigs

- 🐞 **Tools from other games won't crash if user has our extension but the game is not installed**. Until and if Vortex offers isolation from other games touching our stuff, we need to be extra careful not to touch any CP2077-specific stuff until we know that the user is actually invoking one of our tools.

# Cyberpunk 2077 Vortex Support v0.9.0 "Rogue"

> This city will get you every time. You think you have it all for a minute, a crew like no other, a plan that'll make you rich or make you a legend... and then somebody sets off a nuke and it's all ash in the sky. But you pick yourself up under the red twilight that reminds you of what you lost every single day, and you keep going. Make the deals, take the jobs, get involved with the wrong people in the right places. You reinvent yourself. You rebuild. You survive.
>
> You thrive. You come out on top, untouchable, and it's your city now. Because you were always the Queen.

As always, all feedback is appreciated so we can ensure that no bugs or oversights have slipped through our testing — and any suggestions and ideas are welcome too! Please get in touch either on Discord, Github, or Nexus (links at the bottom).

## Main Jobs

- ✨ **Full REDmod support!** You can install and manage REDmods alongside all the others. *Note:* this is for new installations or reinstalls only. We don't want to accidentally break your existing mods, so you can choose when and if you want to migrate them yourself! Just hit Reinstall when you're ready.

- ✨ **Load Ordering!** Drag and drop to order any mods that need ordering! Topmost is highest priority. Note that load order _only_ works on REDmods, and that the game will always load old-style archives at a higher priority and therefore override REDmods (this is where autoconversion comes in handy). Unmanaged REDmods are not supported at this time, so you'll need to reinstall them through Vortex to get everything to play nice together.

- ✨ **Autoconversion of old-style mods to REDmods!** This is a _togglable_ feature (check out Settings), but we highly recommend that you leave it on unless there's an issue installing a mod.

- ✨ **Automatic REDmod deployment!** Yep, no need to hit the terminal, every time you run a deployment in Vortex, your load order is deployed too. As soon as you see the notification that it's done, you can just start the game. And you can trigger a **REDdeployment on-demand**, too, at the click of a button in the toolbar.

- ✨ **Jack right in!** Finally, the default launch button will launch the game directly, with REDmods enabled. No need for the terminal or a separate launcher. If you _do_ want to go through the launcher (for achievements, perhaps), there's the REDlauncher Tool in your toolbar and dashboard that will do just that.

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐞 All fixes we needed to make were released in v0.8.1, v0.8.2, and v0.8.3, this one's the big leagues.

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

- 🩻 A major addition is the ability to define mod type data. In this release it's used to support REDmods, but in the future it can be used for things like true conflict checking, safe cleanup scripts for tricky mods, and so much more...
- ⚙️ All the internal changes and refactorings are too numerous to mention, but we were able to build on the foundation we'd already set up and make some major changes, and we've got some new foundations to build nova stuff on.

We'll collect any tutorials, walkthroughs and other info on the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196) for you!

## The Crew

Mostly Auska (@effs) and Ellie (@E1337Kat) this time around, but we're grateful for the help from both CDPR and Nexus Mods immediately after the REDmodding news dropped - special thanks to @Pickysaurus for even contributing code, and @rfuzzo for bearing with the endlessly meticulous questions about REDmodding implementation minutiae to make sure we'd be able to be 100% compatible! (Pretty sure we hit every remaining bug and quirk in the redmodding tools in this process :innocent:)

As always, thanks to all of you for your feedback, suggestions, bug reports, support, and in this case a little patience too!

FIXES Core Redscript to support v0.5.7.

- ✨ Input Loader's XML mods (in `r6/input/`) are now supported! [\#167 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/167)

- ✨ The CyberCAT support led to building Tool installation functionality, and we'll refine it some more. [\#173 by @Bladehawke](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/173)
- 🧪 Automated tests for all the new stuff as always
- ♻️ No major refactors, but the usual fixing and extracting as part of feature work
- λ ...And Auska snuck in some more functional stuff from fp-ts mwahahaha

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0

## Detes

CyberCAT can now be installed via Vortex. You can use it in the usual manner after installation, but we've also wrapped it up as a Tool
that you can use from Vortex directly! The Tool is just a bit finicky on the first run - just make sure that you have _enabled_ the mod,
and that you have _restarted_ Vortex _after_ that. Then you should see a nice shiny button for CyberCAT right on your dashboard. If the
button is grayed out, make sure you have the mod enabled, restart Vortex again, and it should work.

As usual, CyberCAT can load any save file and you can load presets from anywhere, but if you install one via Vortex, it'll be placed
in the `V2077/presets/cybercat/` directory. The Unlocker presets get placed in the same directory that Unlocker itself uses, and should
be picked up automatically.

## The Crew

No new Netrunners for this release, but @Bladehawke and @E1337Kat are back, and coordination with
mod authors was great as always - thanks for all your help, ideas, and support!

# Cyberpunk2077 Vortex Support 0.6.0 "Evelyn"

_It's all about appearances. Press of a button, a touch of a brush, a new identity, new location, new outfit, new decor. Fit in
anywhere. Don't just survive, *belong*. And keep your eyes open for those shards and datapads. People are so trusting, especially
when they're.. distracted. Appearances get you the information. Forget the iron, information is what makes legends. I wouldn't come
to just anyone with this, but you were highly recommended, and I can see why..._

## Main Jobs

- ✨ Appearance Menu Mod, AMM to chooms, gets dedicated support! There's a ton of AMM mods and we want to make sure that we can support them
  beyond what just generic CET support provides where needed. [\#149 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/149)
- ✨ ...And one of the first things is that we can tell AMM mods apart - you can for example drop a plain location file into Vortex and we'll
  put it in the right place for you! Or any other Collab or User mod, or several kinds at once! [\#156 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/156)
- ✨ Extra text and image files will no longer confuse the poor extension - they're probably documentation or other relevant detes, so we'll make sure
  to install them with the mod. To avoid littering everywhere, we put them all in a special directory in your game dir so that they're
  conveniently accessible in one place. [\#148 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/148)

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐛 Redscript won't complain even if it has to go two or more subdirectories down to find the first `.reds` file, which should help
  ensure modders can create layouts that make sense for their redscript mod - thanks for the bug report and being all nice about it :) [\#159 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/159)

# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.5.0 "T-Bug" Is Here!

You can update it directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github for that matter):
https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

No time for chit-chat, laser-sharp focus on _\*checks shard\*_ config mod support. That’s right, just pop this in and Vortex will
pick up the skills to handle JSON and XML in a few milliseconds! We’re also putting some ICE around your most valuable assets and
protect some files from _accidental_ overwrites.

Why use a mod manager? In addition to quality-of-life improvements like automatically fixing many common types of mod structure
problems that you'd have to do by, clear (?) instructions on any possile additional steps for any given mod or problem
encountered, and the easy ability to enable/disable mods, you also get profiles to manage separate sets of mods more easily,
update notifications, much easier game upgrades, easy toggling between multiple versions or variants (e.g. colors) of a mod. And
you can of course install mods from any source - even the mod showcase channel!

As always, any feedback and such is appreciated so we can ensure that no bugs or oversights have slipped through our testing - and
other feedback and ideas are more than welcome! Please get in touch either on Discord, Github, or Nexus (links at the bottom).

## Main Jobs

- ✨ Config XML support by @effs in https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/134
- ✨ Config JSON support in MultiType by @effs in https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/137

- These two come with the concept and feature of "protected paths": you may for example already have changes in your input mapping
  file, so we’ll warn you about it so that you can back it up and/or merge the two (…actual merge functionality not included in
  this release).

## Fixer Gigs

- 🐛 Fixed MultiType installation bug that affected \(Vehicle Combat\) [\#118](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/issues/118)
- ✨ JSON Should Prompt, Maybe — and now it does, instead of blocking the install [\#113](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/issues/113)

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

- ♻️ Start Splitting Tests by @effs in https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/136
- ♻️ Improved prompting

# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.4.1 or _The Sandra Release_ is here!

You can update it directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github for that matter):
https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

We wanted to get the XL supports in there sooner than later, but know we did not want to compromise on quality of the release. In
common with Sandra Dorsett, this release makes use of some mad programming skills all hidden behind an innocent facade. Hopefully
the release does not take on the trait of being on ice though!

Why use a mod manager? Glad you asked! We appreciate it's been rocky with the original developer unable to continue, but that's
why we're doing it now. There's still work to get to what we consider baseline functionality (and then we get to the fun stuff!)
but you can already install pretty much any mod and get helpful info about any additional steps to take and any problems we
notice. You can install mods from any source (yes, even showcase channels!), not just Nexus. The manager makes it a lot easier to
handle e.g. game upgrades, switching between different characters or other different setups through Profiles, and tells you about
updates for Nexus mods, lets you have multiple versions of any given mod and enable/disable stuff with a click, and lots besides.

## Main Jobs

- Giftwrapping! Got a fresh mod but the mod author packaged it in a single folder and zipped that up? hey it happens, and we want to support you in your unwrapping efforts! Have a merry ~~xmas~~ ~~ramadan~~ ~~birthday~~ uhh.... Celebratory Mod Day?
- TweakXL and ArchiveXL support!
- Some improvements (?) to info and prompt texts, and generally always trying to prompt to let you choose if you want to proceed rather than stop the installation

## Gigs

- A couple Redscript edge cases affecting e.g. StreetStyle and LHUD patches fixed - these won't refuse to install anymore.

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

- Internalized Pipeline! this ensures we have full control over installation, and makes future changes easier :slight_smile:

# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.3.0 or _The Jackie Release_

This marks our first major release since picking this project up. This is a rather thick release full of support and changes that
will at the very least make a lot of mods easier to install. We are calling this the Jackie release because it is big and amazing
and full of goodness. Sure it isn't perfect. You will find there there are issues with TweakXL and ArchiveXL mods saying they
couldn't be installed as desired... but that's because they didn't exist when we decided on this milestone. Hope y'all enjoy your
time modding Night City!

Bug reports here or on Discord appreciated!

## What's Changed

- Generally a bunch more usable
- Most mod types and file layouts now supported (CET, Redscript, Red4Ext, INI, Reshade, JSON config, Archives...)
- Anything not directly supported (yet) can be installed (but we'll prompt you for it)
- Helpful (?) error and info messages
- Lots of under the hood changes

## Known Issues

- TweakXL and ArchiveXL give false negatives on install, but most mods using them will be packaged correctly and can be installed fine via the "fallback" installer
- when the fallback installer is hit, the file list includes folders. this is quirk in how files are passed around in vortex, but not really a problem... this quirk is also what made 0.2.1 so bad, but that's long ago.
