# Cyberpunk2077 Vortex Support v0.8.0 "TAKEMURA"

Beware mean reds. Gotta keep moving, gotta stay crystal, never lose focus - 'specially when you think you're gold. You might've put together the sharpest crew since the 20's, but you only gotta be unlucky once. Make exit, don't stand still, gear up, chrome up, change your face if you gotta. They're gonna come for you and the only way out is up.

Update directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

Why use a mod manager? In addition to quality-of-life improvements like automatically fixing many common types of mod structure problems that you'd have to do by hand, clear (?) instructions on any possile additional steps for any given mod or problem encountered, and the easy ability to enable/disable mods, you also get profiles to manage separate sets of mods more easily, update notifications, much easier game upgrades, easy toggling between multiple versions or variants (e.g. colors) of a mod, Collections, and all sorts of nice things. And you can of course install mods from any source - even the mod showcase channel, and they do not even need to be in a zipfile. We gotchu.

As always, any feedback and such is appreciated so we can ensure that no bugs or oversights have slipped through our testing - and other feedback and ideas are more than welcome! Please get in touch either on Discord, Github, or Nexus (links at the bottom).

# Cyberpunk2077 Vortex Support v0.7.0 "Meredith"

_Don't get too attached, you're just a tool to get the job done... even if part of it seems to merge biz with something a bit more personal,
and a whole different look. Input? Output? Not up to you. But that's corpo life for you. Play your cards right, and maybe you're just left
wondering why your holo goes unanswered next morning instead of finding yourself in concrete overshoes having outlived your usefulness._

Update directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

Why use a mod manager? In addition to quality-of-life improvements like automatically fixing many common types of mod structure
problems that you'd have to do by hand, clear (?) instructions on any possile additional steps for any given mod or problem
encountered, and the easy ability to enable/disable mods, you also get profiles to manage separate sets of mods more easily,
update notifications, much easier game upgrades, easy toggling between multiple versions or variants (e.g. colors) of a mod,
Collections, and all sorts of nice things. And you can of course install mods from any source - even the mod showcase channel, and
they do not even need to be in a zipfile. We gotchu.

## Main Jobs

- ‚ú® Initial support for CyberCAT GUI as a Tool! See below for the detes. [\#164 by @Bladehawke](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/164)
- ‚ú® Input Loader's XML mods (in `r6/input/`) are now supported! [\#167 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/167)
  - ‚ú® Input Loader itself is treated as a Core enabling mod, and also uninstalls cleanly! [\#174 by @Bladehawke](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/174)
- ‚ú® Character preset support for _both_ CyberCAT _and_ Appearance Change Unlocker presets - and we figure out which kind it is! [\#169 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/169)

## Fixer Gigs

- ‚ö∞Ô∏è CSVMerge and its dependency on Wolvenkit CLI deprecated. [\#171 @Bladehawke](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/171)
- üêõ A few reports around Input Loader support got fixed!

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

- ‚ú® The CyberCAT support led to building Tool installation functionality, and we'll refine it some more. [\#173 by @Bladehawke](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/173)
- üß™ Automated tests for all the new stuff as always
- ‚ôªÔ∏è No major refactors, but the usual fixing and extracting as part of feature work
- Œª ...And Auska snuck in some more functional stuff from fp-ts mwahahaha

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0

## Detes

CyberCAT can now be installed via Vortex. You can use it in the usual manner after installation, but we've also wrapped it up as a Tool
that you can use from Vortex directly! The Tool is just a bit finicky on the first run - just make sure that you have _enabled_ the mod,
and that you have _restarted_ Vortex _after_ that. Then you should see a nice shiny button for CyberCAT right on your dashboard. If the
button is grayed out, make sure you have the mod enabled, restart Vortex again, and it should work.

As usual, CyberCAT can load any save file and you can load presets from anywhere, but if you install one via Vortex, it'll be placed
in the `V2077/presets/cybercat/` directory. The Unlocker presets get placed in the same directory that Unlocker itself uses, and should
be picked up automatically.

## The Crew

No new Netrunners for this release, but @Bladehawke and @E1337Kat are back, and coordination with
mod authors was great as always - thanks for all your help, ideas, and support!

# Cyberpunk2077 Vortex Support 0.6.0 "Evelyn"

_It's all about appearances. Press of a button, a touch of a brush, a new identity, new location, new outfit, new decor. Fit in
anywhere. Don't just survive, *belong*. And keep your eyes open for those shards and datapads. People are so trusting, especially
when they're.. distracted. Appearances get you the information. Forget the iron, information is what makes legends. I wouldn't come
to just anyone with this, but you were highly recommended, and I can see why..._

## Main Jobs

- ‚ú® Appearance Menu Mod, AMM to chooms, gets dedicated support! There's a ton of AMM mods and we want to make sure that we can support them
  beyond what just generic CET support provides where needed. [\#149 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/149)
- ‚ú® ...And one of the first things is that we can tell AMM mods apart - you can for example drop a plain location file into Vortex and we'll
  put it in the right place for you! Or any other Collab or User mod, or several kinds at once! [\#156 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/156)
- ‚ú® Extra text and image files will no longer confuse the poor extension - they're probably documentation or other relevant detes, so we'll make sure
  to install them with the mod. To avoid littering everywhere, we put them all in a special directory in your game dir so that they're
  conveniently accessible in one place. [\#148 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/148)

## Fixer Gigs

- üêõ Redscript won't complain even if it has to go two or more subdirectories down to find the first `.reds` file, which should help
  ensure modders can create layouts that make sense for their redscript mod - thanks for the bug report and being all nice about it :) [\#159 by Auska](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/159)

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

- GH build improvements [\#154 by @E1337Kat](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/154)
- Tests check that dialogs and notifications are shown where expected
- Bunch of big and small refactors and QoL stuff for development

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0

No new Netrunners for this release, but lots of helpful feedback, thank you!

# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.5.0 "T-Bug" Is Here!

You can update it directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github for that matter):
https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

No time for chit-chat, laser-sharp focus on _\*checks shard\*_ config mod support. That‚Äôs right, just pop this in and Vortex will
pick up the skills to handle JSON and XML in a few milliseconds! We‚Äôre also putting some ICE around your most valuable assets and
protect some files from _accidental_ overwrites.

Why use a mod manager? In addition to quality-of-life improvements like automatically fixing many common types of mod structure
problems that you'd have to do by, clear (?) instructions on any possile additional steps for any given mod or problem
encountered, and the easy ability to enable/disable mods, you also get profiles to manage separate sets of mods more easily,
update notifications, much easier game upgrades, easy toggling between multiple versions or variants (e.g. colors) of a mod. And
you can of course install mods from any source - even the mod showcase channel!

## Main Jobs

- ‚ú® Config XML support by @effs in https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/134
- ‚ú® Config JSON support in MultiType by @effs in https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/pull/137

- These two come with the concept and feature of "protected paths": you may for example already have changes in your input mapping
  file, so we‚Äôll warn you about it so that you can back it up and/or merge the two (‚Ä¶actual merge functionality not included in
  this release).

## Fixer Gigs

- üêõ Fixed MultiType installation bug that affected \(Vehicle Combat\) [\#118](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/issues/118)
- ‚ú® JSON Should Prompt, Maybe ‚Äî and now it does, instead of blocking the install [\#113](https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/issues/113)

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.4.1 or _The Sandra Release_ is here!

You can update it directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github for that matter):
https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

We wanted to get the XL supports in there sooner than later, but know we did not want to compromise on quality of the release. In
common with Sandra Dorsett, this release makes use of some mad programming skills all hidden behind an innocent facade. Hopefully
the release does not take on the trait of being on ice though!

Why use a mod manager? Glad you asked! We appreciate it's been rocky with the original developer unable to continue, but that's
why we're doing it now. There's still work to get to what we consider baseline functionality (and then we get to the fun stuff!)
but you can already install pretty much any mod and get helpful info about any additional steps to take and any problems we
notice. You can install mods from any source (yes, even showcase channels!), not just Nexus. The manager makes it a lot easier to
handle e.g. game upgrades, switching between different characters or other different setups through Profiles, and tells you about
updates for Nexus mods, lets you have multiple versions of any given mod and enable/disable stuff with a click, and lots besides.

As always, any feedback and such is appreciated so we can ensure that no bugs or oversights have slipped through our testing - and
other feedback and ideas are more than welcome! Please get in touch either on Discord, Github, or Nexus (links at the bottom).

## Main Jobs

- Giftwrapping! Got a fresh mod but the mod author packaged it in a single folder and zipped that up? hey it happens, and we want to support you in your unwrapping efforts! Have a merry ~~xmas~~ ~~ramadan~~ ~~birthday~~ uhh.... Celebratory Mod Day?
- TweakXL and ArchiveXL support!
- Some improvements (?) to info and prompt texts, and generally always trying to prompt to let you choose if you want to proceed rather than stop the installation

## Gigs

- A couple Redscript edge cases affecting e.g. StreetStyle and LHUD patches fixed - these won't refuse to install anymore.

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)

- Internalized Pipeline! this ensures we have full control over installation, and makes future changes easier :slight_smile:

# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.3.0 or _The Jackie Release_

This marks our first major release since picking this project up. This is a rather thick release full of support and changes that
will at the very least make a lot of mods easier to install. We are calling this the Jackie release because it is big and amazing
and full of goodness. Sure it isn't perfect. You will find there there are issues with TweakXL and ArchiveXL mods saying they
couldn't be installed as desired... but that's because they didn't exist when we decided on this milestone. Hope y'all enjoy your
time modding Night City!

Bug reports here or on Discord appreciated!

## What's Changed

- Generally a bunch more usable
- Most mod types and file layouts now supported (CET, Redscript, Red4Ext, INI, Reshade, JSON config, Archives...)
- Anything not directly supported (yet) can be installed (but we'll prompt you for it)
- Helpful (?) error and info messages
- Lots of under the hood changes

## Known Issues

- TweakXL and ArchiveXL give false negatives on install, but most mods using them will be packaged correctly and can be installed fine via the "fallback" installer
- when the fallback installer is hit, the file list includes folders. this is quirk in how files are passed around in vortex, but not really a problem... this quirk is also what made 0.2.1 so bad, but that's long ago.
