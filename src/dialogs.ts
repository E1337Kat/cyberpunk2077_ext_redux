        It's possible that this is intentional, but you might also be expected to only pick some
        of the files to use, or it could be an oversight or an unstructured mod.

        Make sure to read any instructions the mod might have, and then if necessary adjust the installation manually.
        You can open and modify the mod by clicking 'Open in File Manager' in the Action Menu (dropdown next to 'Remove').

        If you want to keep multiple variants of the mod (for different colors, for example), you can click 'Reinstall'
        in the Action Menu, and select to install a variant (give it a good name!).

        These are the files I installed:

        ${files.join("\n")}`,
